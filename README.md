# Simulations_by_yongkyu
This repository contains some simulation codes written in Julia language by myself. The topics are mainly on advanced queueing theories and some applications of them.

I refer to the textbook of Dr. Natarajan Gautam (Analysis of Queues, 2012) who is the advisor of my advisor Prof. Young Myoung Ko.
If you have any questions on the codes, don't hesitate send me a e-mail. (jyg1124@gmail.com).
