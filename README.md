# Experiments
This repository contains some codes written in Julia language for numerical experimants. The topics are mainly on advanced queueing theories and some applications of them.
I refer to the textbook of Dr. Natarajan Gautam (Analysis of Queues, 2012). He is the advisor of my advisor Prof. Young Myoung Ko.
